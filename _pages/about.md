I am a PhD candidate at the Computer Science Department at Aalto University. My research is interdisciplinary between the fields of law and computer science. I aim to leverage computational approaches to analyze legal
semantics and decision-making processes. Currently, my focus is on studying law as a complex system through the
lens of network science, as well as on using machine learning to extract relevant information from this
complex system. My research  deals with the specifics of legal language, the legal system itself, and with
legislative and judicial procedures. Ultimately, I aim to translate my findings into tools that can strengthen
democracies.

Alltough coding has been a passion for a very long time, I spent most of my academic career (so far) studying law at the Humboldt-University of Berlin. There, I thinking about law and competition within digital markets. I successfully optained a law degree in September 2023. Since then, I have been deepening my knowledge of computing, data science, and programmingâ€”both - through working at the software team of a law firm and by completing a full-time bootcamp in Data Science.

Besides Coding and Law, I have a big passion for music. I love to compose, produce, and perform electronic music, aiming for a new sound between synthetic and classical music. To find out more about this - and listen - feel free to check out the [Titus Flavius Spotify Page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4pSvvLpY4sQ6DLzqfeH92F?si=aRsuefXuRJa0XBwz_P_WJA).
