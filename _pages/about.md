I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University. My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of law and computer science. My goal is to use computational approaches to analyze legal semantics and decision-making processes. Currently, my focus is on studying law as a complex system through thelens of network science, as well as on using machine learning to extract relevant information from this complex system. Specifically, my research deals with legal language, the legal system itself, and legislative and judicial procedures. Ultimately, I aim to translate my findings into tools that can strengthen democracies.

Although I have been passionate about coding for a very long time, I have spent most of my academic career studying law at Humboldt University in Berlin. There, I specialized in competition law within digital markets. I successfully graduated with the First Legal State Examination in September 2023. Since then, I have worked as part of a law firm's software team and completed a full-time Data Science bootcamp. Through these experiences, I have delved further into computing, data science, and coding. As of last September, I have been pursuing this journey academically.

Besides coding and law, I am passionate about music and related creative fields. I love composing, producing, and performing electronic music, aiming blend synthetic sounds with classical music. To find out more about this - and listen - feel free to check out the [Titus Flavius Spotify Page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4pSvvLpY4sQ6DLzqfeH92F?si=aRsuefXuRJa0XBwz_P_WJA).
